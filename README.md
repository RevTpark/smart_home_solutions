# Smart Home IOE Project
### TODO: Add Image of Project and Video Link
The smart home solution project is a system that utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect motion in a room and turn on LED lights based on the intensity of a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensor. The project also includes a DHT sensor that detects the temperature and humidity of the room and controls the speed of a fan accordingly. Additionally, the system sends an email and a WhatsApp message to the user upon detecting motion for the first time, providing them with the temperature and humidity readings of the room. Overall, the project aims to enhance the safety and comfort of homes by automating certain tasks based on environmental conditions.

## Features
- **Motion Detection**: The project uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect motion in a room.

- **LED Intensity**: The intensity of the LED is controlled based on the reading from an LDR sensor.

- **Fan Control**: The project also controls a fan based on temperature readings from a DHT sensor.

- **Email and Whatsapp Notifications**: When motion is detected for the first time, the project sends an email and WhatsApp message to the user, greeting them and giving them the temperature and humidity readings of the room.
